## Recommendations for Test Reduction

### ðŸŽ¯ **Keep All Tests (High Priority)**
- Kafka Integration Tests (1 file)
- File Processor Unit Tests (1 file)
- All CRUD Integration Tests (4 files)
- All Database Schema Tests (4 files)

**Total: 10 files (71% of tests)**

### ðŸ”„ **Simplify Performance Tests (Medium Priority)**
- Keep 1-2 key performance tests per service instead of 8-10
- Focus on critical performance scenarios:
  - Bulk insert performance
  - Query performance with indexes
  - Pagination performance
- Remove redundant tests like:
  - Multiple concurrent operation variations
  - Memory usage tests
  - Connection pool tests

**Reduction: 4 files â†’ 1-2 files per service (50-75% reduction)**

### ðŸ“Š **Summary of Reduction**
- **Current:** 14 test files
- **After Reduction:** 10-12 test files
- **Reduction:** 15-30% fewer tests
- **Maintained Coverage:** 100% of critical business logic
- **Improved Maintainability:** Fewer tests to maintain while keeping essential coverage

## Test Categories by Business Value

### **Critical (Must Keep)**
1. Kafka Integration Tests
2. File Processor Unit Tests
3. All CRUD Integration Tests

### **Important (Should Keep)**
4. All Database Schema Tests

### **Nice to Have (Can Simplify)**
5. Performance Tests (reduce from 4 files to 1-2 files)

## Conclusion

The integration test suite is well-structured and covers critical business functionality. The recommended reduction focuses on simplifying performance tests while maintaining 100% coverage of critical business logic. This approach will reduce maintenance overhead while ensuring system reliability.
